        <h5>Sam Archer</h5>
        <p>The old adage - "I wasn't born in Austin but I got here as soon as I could" is definitely the case for me. I came to Austin in 1993 to attend the LBJ School of Public Affairs after spending over two years in Guatemala as a Peace Corps Volunteer. I hold a BA in Government from Harvard University.
        <p>I grew up around real estate working alongside my brothers and sister in South Carolina where my father thought the best way to keep us out of trouble was to have us productively engaged. I bought my first investment property in Austin in 1995 and have been an active investor since that time. I have been a licensed realtor and now broker since 2005.</p>
        <p>Since 2005 I have assisted a wide array of clients all over Austin, and personally experienced many sides of the real estate transaction as buyer, seller and investor. I joined forces as a founding member of Juice because of our shared core values in helping people and maintaining client relationships that extend beyond the closing table.</p>
        <div class="more_text less">
          <p>Time outside of work is dedicated to helping my two teenage sons begin the process of moving toward their next stage in life, college and beyond. I'm an avid soccer player and most weekends find myself down at Zilker for some pick-up games. Community involvement has involved being the chair of the Waller Creek Citizen Advisory Committee and working on volunteer projects in my neighborhood of Hyde Park.</p>

          <p>Additionally to being a co-owner of Juice Real Estate Co., I am a co-owner of RAM Austin Property Management and have a four-year history of managing properties for clients. This added professional focus means I bring more market-based knowledge regarding the rental market and the dynamics of the investor perspective.</p>

          <p>Background:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Formation of Juice Homes, LLC Partnership, 2009</li>
            <li>Certified Negotiation Expert</li>
            <li>Ninja Selling Trained Agent</li>
            <li>Consistent Top 5% Agent in Total Volume among peers</li>
            <li>Returned Peace Corps Volunteer</li>
            <li>Graduate UT at Austin - LBJ School of Public Affairs</li>
            <li>Owner of RAM Austin Property Management</li>

        <h5>Adam Styer</h5>
        <p>After graduating from the University of Toledo majoring in Finance, I began my financial services career as an investment and insurance advisor at a company called Savage and Associates. At Savage, I was able to learn from some of the best avisors in the business and gained invaluable insights into what it takes to build an overall solid financial plan.
        <p>While I loved Toledo, Ohio, it was time to venture south to the great state of Texas where I have called home for 8+ years. My time in Austin has been spent with several companies in the financial services industry. I worked for Chase Bank for 3+ years as Personal Banker and again was exposed to a broad specturm of products and services in both the consumer and commercial side ranging from checking accounts to mortgages, investments, loans, and credit cards.</p>
        <div class="more_text">
          <p>After Chase and a short sabatical to Kodiak, AK where I worked as a commercial fisherman, I began working for the Austin-based financial services company, BancVue, as a Retail Experience Consultant. I traveled all over the country (150+ flights/year!) training BancVue's clients on our financial products, sales strategies and helped improve their retail branch environment through consultation.</p>
          <p>Through this extensive experience in the financial services industry, I saw an opportunity to use the knowledge and skills I developed to help people get into their dream home, save money, or to just be a source of information. I know how important a home is to people emotionally, I've been through it myself. I also understand how important a mortgage is to a person's overall financial plan. My mission is to combine my knowledge with honesty and integrity and to tirelessly work to get you the right loan for your situation. I will always find you a fair deal and treat each one of my clients as if the loan was for my own home. I'll be with you every step of the way.</p>
