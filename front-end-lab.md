## Front End Lab
Today we're going to walk through the process of turning a design comp into a tangible site.

### Design Comps
Design comps come in many forms but you'll most likely see PSD files. Sometimes designers will give you the necessary assets but other times it is up to you to extract them. If you receive a PDF, I'd highly recommend you push back and get the psd.

Once the comp is in your hands, there are a few things you want to do upfront before ever even starting to code:

- Fonts: are they webfonts? googlefonts?
- Responsiveness: is there another comp for smaller devices or is it up to you to make it fit logically
- Images: extract from file and save as jpgs or pngs as necessary. Size matters, so maybe run it through an image optimizer!
- Functionality:
	- does the header stay at the top?
	- do images link somewhere?
	- hover states
	- form submission
- Division of the page - are there logical sections? elements?
- What elements are being reused?
- Libraries + Frameworks: Bootstrap? jQuery?

### HTML

- sections
- class and id naming
- semantic elements: header, nav, footer
	- nav's usually consist of lists with anchors inside of them
	- logo needs to fit within the nav or header
- container element!

### CSS

- reset or normalize http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
- google fonts
- vertical alignment
- hover effects
- margin and padding consistency
- organization of styles
